# Void Player Character Common

This library houses all common functionality across my Void player-character mods that would otherwise be copy/pasted between them. It is responsible for providing references to damage types and visual effects that these mods use.

While this could theoretically be used by other mod creators, please note that this was mostly designed for personal use.

This mod also includes a number of behavioral options (currently only one but there are a few in mind) to affect how Void-related entities behave, such as if fog immunity should be enforced.
