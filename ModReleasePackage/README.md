# Void Player Character Common

This library houses all common functionality across my Void player-character mods that would otherwise be copy/pasted between them. It is responsible for providing references to damage types and visual effects that these mods use.

While this could theoretically be used by other mod creators, please note that this was mostly designed for personal use.

# Configurable Features

* **Enforce Native Void Immunity** - Prevents all vanilla Void enemies from taking damage whilst outside of a protective area. This mostly applies to Simulacrum.
* **Player Black Hole Behavior** - Global settings manage the defaults for all of my playable Void enemy mods. They can still be independently configured in their respective settings.
